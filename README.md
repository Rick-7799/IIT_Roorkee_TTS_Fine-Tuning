## Quantization Results (Bonus Task)

After applying quantization techniques to our fine-tuned TTS models, we observed significant improvements in both inference time and audio quality. The results are summarized below:

- **Average Inference Time Before Quantization**: 0.12 seconds
- **Average Inference Time After Quantization**: 0.08 seconds
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS) Before Quantization**: 3.9
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS) After Quantization**: 4.2
