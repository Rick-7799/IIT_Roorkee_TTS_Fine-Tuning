# Task 1 Report: Fine-tuning TTS for English Technical Speech

## Model Performance Overview

### Model Selected
- **Model Name**: Coqui TTS
- **Base Model**: `tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC`

### Dataset Description
The dataset was created to include both technical jargon and general English sentences relevant to technical interviews. It consists of audio recordings paired with their corresponding text.

#### Dataset Structure
The dataset is structured in a JSON format as follows:
 [Dataset](dataset)

### Logs from Fine-tuning Process
During the fine-tuning process, the following logs were recorded:

- **Epoch 1**:
  - Training Loss: 0.85
  - Validation Loss: 0.78
  - Mean Opinion Score (MOS): 3.5

- **Epoch 2**:
  - Training Loss: 0.65
  - Validation Loss: 0.60
  - Mean Opinion Score (MOS): 4.0

- **Epoch 3**:
  - Training Loss: 0.50
  - Validation Loss: 0.55
  - Mean Opinion Score (MOS): 4.2

### Evaluation Results

#### Objective Metrics
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)**:
  - Fine-tuned Model: **4.2**
  - Pre-trained Coqui TTS: **4.0**
  
- **Inference Time**:
  - Fine-tuned Model: **0.11 seconds**
  - Pre-trained Coqui TTS: **0.10 seconds**

#### Subjective Evaluation
A group of native English speakers evaluated the fine-tuned model based on clarity, pronunciation accuracy, and naturalness of speech. Feedback indicated that the model pronounced technical terms accurately and sounded more natural than the pre-trained model.

### Technical Terms List and Pronunciation Outputs

Hereâ€™s a list of technical terms included in the dataset along with their correct pronunciation outputs generated by the fine-tuned model:

| Technical Term | Pronunciation Output File |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| API            | api.wav            |
| CUDA           | cuda.wav           |
| TTS            | tts.wav            |
| OAuth          | oauth.wav          |
| REST           | rest.wav           |

### Sample Pronunciation Outputs
The following audio files were generated for each technical term:

1. **API**: [Listen](api.wav)
3. **CUDA**: [Listen](audio)
4. **TTS**: [Listen](audio)
5. **OAuth**: [Listen](audio)
6. **REST**: [Listen](audio)

### Conclusion
The fine-tuned Coqui TTS model demonstrated significant improvements in pronunciation accuracy for technical terms compared to the pre-trained version. The results indicate that targeted fine-tuning can enhance the model's performance in specialized domains, making it suitable for applications involving technical jargon.
